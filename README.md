## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
## Database Migrations

The project uses Sequelize migrations to manage database schema changes. Here are the available migration commands:

```bash
# Generate a new migration file
$ npm run migration:generate <migration-name>

# Run all pending migrations
$ npm run migration:run

# Revert the last executed migration
$ npm run migration:revert

# Revert all migrations
$ npm run migration:revert:all
```

### Examples

Generate a new migration:
```bash
$ npm run migration:generate add-role-to-users
```

Run pending migrations:
```bash
$ npm run migration:run
```

Revert last migration:
```bash
$ npm run migration:revert
```

### Migration Files

Migration files are located in `src/database/migrations`. Each migration has an `up` method for applying the changes and a `down` method for reverting them.

For more information about migrations, check out the [Sequelize documentation](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/).

## Database Seeders

The project includes database seeders for both development and production environments. Seeders help you populate your database with initial or test data.

### Development Seeders

Development seeders include test data useful for local development and testing:

```bash
# Generate a new seeder file
$ npm run seed:generate <seeder-name>

# Run all development seeders
$ npm run seed:run

# Undo last executed seeder
$ npm run seed:undo

# Undo all seeders
$ npm run seed:undo:all
```

Example of development data included:
- Test users with different roles
- Sample data for testing features
- Development environment configurations

### Production Seeders

Production seeders are specifically designed for initializing essential data in production:

```bash
# Run production initial admin seeder
$ npm run seed:prod

# Undo production initial admin seeder
$ npm run seed:prod:undo
```

Production seeder includes:
- Initial admin user creation
- Essential system configurations
- Required initial data

### Environment Variables for Production Seeder

Make sure to set up these environment variables for the production seeder:

```env
ADMIN_NAME=Administrator
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@company.com
ADMIN_RUT=11111111-1
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### Important Notes

- Development seeders should only be used in development environment
- Production seeders include safety checks to prevent duplicate data
- Always backup your database before running seeders in production
- Production seeders will only run if NODE_ENV=production

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
